# MDP_Algorithm
### NTU SC2079 Multidisciplinary Design Project Algorithm
This project utilizes Pygame to simulate MDP's Week 8 obstacle detection challenge. The Hamiltonian path and A* search algorithm are used to determine the order in which to visit the obstacles and the robot's movements to follow that path.
### Installing Dependencies
- pip install -r requirements.txt
